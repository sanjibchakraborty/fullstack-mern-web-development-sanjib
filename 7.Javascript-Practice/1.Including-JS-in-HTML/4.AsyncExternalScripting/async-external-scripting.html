      Including external Javascript file inside 'head' tag using 'script' tag
      along with 'async' attribute.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <b>async</b> attribute is somewhat like <b>defer</b>. It also makes
      the script non-blocking. But it has important differences in the behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The browser doesn’t block on <b>async</b> scripts (like <b>defer</b>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Other scripts don’t wait for <b>async</b> scripts, and
      <b>async</b> scripts don’t wait for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="background-color: lightgray">DOMContentLoaded</span> and
      <b>async</b> scripts don’t wait for each other:
      <span style="background-color: lightgray">DOMContentLoaded</span> may
      happen both before an <b>async</b> script or after an <b>async</b> script
