    <p>
      The <b>defer</b> attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script.
      Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The
      script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the DOM is fully
      built.
    </p>
    <p>Scripts with <b>defer</b> never block the page.</p>
    <p>
      Scripts with <b>defer</b> always execute when the DOM is ready (but before
      <span style="background-color: lightgray">DOMContentLoaded</span> event)
    </p>
    <p>The page content shows up immediately.</p>
    <p>
      <span style="background-color: lightgray">DOMContentLoaded</span> event
      handler waits for the deferred script. It only triggers when the script is
      downloaded and executed.
